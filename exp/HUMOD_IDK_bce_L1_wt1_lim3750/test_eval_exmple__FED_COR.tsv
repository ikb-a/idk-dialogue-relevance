[CLS] hi ! oh hello . long time no talk . how ' s the day going for yu ##o ? very well , thanks for asking . how has your day been ? getting better . i just recovered from a cold . i got wet in the rain last week . are you planning anything for the holidays ? glad to hear you ' re better . sorry to hear you were sick . i was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough . there ' s definitely a bug going around . admit i just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax . oh same here . i think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays . definitely ! i know a lot of folks travel for the holidays , but i ' m happy to stay home myself ! i ' m getting there . every year until last year , i tried to go somewhere for the christmas / new year , and then i got bored traveling . lo ##l not sure if that means i ' m getting old ? me too . now i have folks come visit me for the holidays ! but that ' s also tires ##ome . . are you doing any home decor ##ating then ? yes ! we set up an eco - friendly ( i . e . fake ) christmas tree and put up some colorful led lights which is very fest ##ive . i think i ' m copying you . me and my wife plan to decorate and christmas tree too . we bought most of the decorative stuff ##s from the stores , but haven ' t yet to buy the tree . buying a tree is a neat experience . i was torn between buying an artificial / eco - friendly / fake one vs . a real one that smells like fresh pine . in the end , we opted for the one that we can di ##sas ##se ##mble every year . i see . artificial anything is better , from tree to intelligence , huh ? oh , very clever pun ! i like it ! depends . i remember having real christmas trees from childhood , but these days with climate change , i think not chop ##ping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do . i see . it ' s probably also cheaper . i ' ll buy an artificial one too . do you have any suggestions for the store ? admit my favorite store is target , plus they often [SEP] ah that ' s great . my wife also likes target a lot . she even made a target credit card because she comes to that store very often . okay thanks for the suggestion . i ' ll check out target .
