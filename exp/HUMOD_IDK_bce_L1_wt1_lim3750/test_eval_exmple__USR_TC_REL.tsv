[CLS] did you see crazy rich asian ##s ? no i haven ' t . i heard it was good . i have not yet either but i am aware of it ' s cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy . my mother like it . i think it stars michelle ye ##oh , henry gold ##ing and constance wu , right ? it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insane ##ly wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background . if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director . yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i ' m glad that it did well . asian ##s seem very under ##re ##pres ##ented in film . the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg - 13 . that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen . well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life . i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth ' s history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat . this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? it ' s very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4 ##x less dense than earth . i know it is much larger but i don ' t think it has any solid ##ity to it so that ' s interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5 . 5 hours long . i didn ' t know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada . i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough [SEP] yeah , and what ' s funny is that new employees employees are called " no ##og ##lers " on their basketball field .

[CLS] are you interested in government related policy i can ' t believe how much of a disaster the festival was . yeah , i can not believe it either i think for the level of this fraud they should have levi ##ed the maximum sentence requested . i con ##cu ##r . these are not the best people . i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior . his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a reg ##urg ##itation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment . even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged . i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand . it would have been nice if they had named the people who were sc ##ammed out of 1 . 2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to def ##ra ##ud went . i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance no i don ' t tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article . okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ? i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ? completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act . yes that would be a deter ##rent . punishments should be harsh ##er to show the judicial system is serious .

[CLS] hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ; ) hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that ' s surprising . doesn ' t sound right ; ) so what do they stand for ? i ' m not sure . doesn ' t make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 ' s , an actress named he ##dy lamar ##r helped to in ##vent wi ##fi , the cell ##phone and gigs . that s surprising ! actress ? i wonder how she did that . . . pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182 , 000 . it was made out of gold and tor ##to ##ises ##hell ! probably some celebrity bought it ; ) regular person wouldn ' t be able to afford it ; ) [SEP] i definitely couldn ' t afford it . did you know that the fiddle and violin are actually exactly the same instrument . the difference is just the type of music you play .

[CLS] did you see crazy rich asian ##s ? no i haven ' t . i heard it was good . i have not yet either but i am aware of it ' s cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy . my mother like it . i think it stars michelle ye ##oh , henry gold ##ing and constance wu , right ? it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insane ##ly wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background . if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director . yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i ' m glad that it did well . asian ##s seem very under ##re ##pres ##ented in film . the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg - 13 . that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen . well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life . i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth ' s history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat . this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? it ' s very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4 ##x less dense than earth . i know it is much larger but i don ' t think it has any solid ##ity to it so that ' s interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5 . 5 hours long . i didn ' t know that . i wonder why . there [SEP] wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller bean ##ie cap on their first friday ? can ' t get any more qui ##rky than that .

[CLS] are you interested in government related policy i can ' t believe how much of a disaster the festival was . yeah , i can not believe it either i think for the level of this fraud they should have levi ##ed the maximum sentence requested . i con ##cu ##r . these are not the best people . i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior . his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a reg ##urg ##itation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment . even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged . i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand . it would have been nice if they had named the people who were sc ##ammed out of 1 . 2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to def ##ra ##ud went . i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance no i don ' t tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article . okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ? i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ? completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act . yes that would be a deter ##rent . punishments should be harsh ##er to show the judicial system is serious .
